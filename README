Apache Portable Runtime JSON Library (APR-JSON)
-----------------------------------------------

The Apache Portable Runtime JSON Library supplies the long-wanted missing
piece in the APR library family, JSON serializer / deserializer.

This work was primarily based on Derek Gottfrid's DBSlayer, but the code
has been significantly improved in various aspects.

While the software is given a name "APR-JSON" and licensed under the Apache
License, it is not an official Apache project.  Please direct feedbacks to
me, rather than to the developers at apache.org.
