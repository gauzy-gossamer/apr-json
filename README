Apache Portable Runtime JSON Library (APR-JSON)
-----------------------------------------------

The Apache Portable Runtime JSON Library supplies the long-wanted missing
piece in the APR library family, JSON serializer / deserializer.

This work was primarily based on Derek Gottfrid's DBSlayer, but the code
has been significantly improved in various aspects.

While the software is licensed in the Apache License, it is not an official
Apache project, so please direct feedbacks to me, rather than to the
developers at apache.org.
